# Parallel computing project #

Comparison of [Global Arrays Toolkit](http://hpc.pnl.gov/globalarrays/) frameworks with [MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) for doing parallel computing. [University of Tartu Rocket cluster](http://www.hpc.ut.ee/rocket_cluster) was used for benchmarking the performance.  

## Comparison of alorithms ##
- 1D array transposition
- Matrix matrix multiplication

Project was implemented as a part of [Parallel Computing course](https://courses.cs.ut.ee/2014/paralleel/fall) in University of Tartu. Complete overview and project results can be found [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/54a913121baac6e428b881e2).
